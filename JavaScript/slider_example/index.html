        <p class="text-1">
                The most precocious composer in musical history, Mozart died at the tragically young age of 35.
                He literally died composing, trying to direct how his Requiem should be completed.<br>
                Although one of his greatest works, one would want to be in a sombre mood to listen to it.<br>                

        </p>
        <p class="text-2">
                The Coronation Mass of 1782 belongs to a repertoire by the main Viennese composers from Mozart 
                to Schubert regularly performed in the city's churches and increasingly in large churches and 
                cathedrals abroad, whether Catholic or Anglican. An enduring memory is of our standing in the 
                Augustinerkirche listening to that beautiful Mozart Mass on the first Sunday in 2002, with an 
                inspiring sermon to match. <br>

        </p>
        <p class="text-3">
                All over the world, Ireland included, the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth in Salzburg on 
                January 27th, 1756, will be celebrated throughout the year in concert programmes. His astonishing 
                talent, including the first attempts at composition, had manifested itself by the age of five. He
                toured the courts of Europe as a child prodigy with his older sister, Nannerl.
        </p>
        <p class="text-4">
                Today, star performers are constantly on the move between cities. It was highly unusual in an age, 
                when coach travel was slow and difficult, and sea journeys long, uncomfortable and hazardous.
        </p>
        <p class="text-5">
                Was Mozart the greatest of all composers? Fifty years ago his music and his memory paled 
                beside Beethoven. In recent years Mozart has come more to the fore, but no composer quite 
                fills the uncontested position occupied by Shakespeare in literature.
        </p>
        <p class="text-6">
                With the exception of choral music like oratorios, the modern symphony orchestra is more geared 
                to large-scale compositions of the 19th and 20th centuries. This year will be an exception, 
                but symphonies of Mozart and Haydn are rarely performed in concert halls.
        </p>
        <p class="text-7">
                On the other hand, baroque and classical music are part of the staple diet of radio stations 
                like Lyric FM that provide a more intimate listening atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p class="text-8">
                The late 18th century was when enlightenment and sensibility were combined.
        </p>
        <p class="text-9">
                A genre in which Mozart particularly excelled was chamber music, serenades, divertimentos, 
                including his beautiful violin concertos. The horn concertos are particularly popular. 
                His last quintets are among his more profound works. The later piano concertos, the clarinet 
                concerto, and the Sinfonia Concertante K. 364 are great music.
